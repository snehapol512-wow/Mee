/*
👉Thread 1 acquires a lock on Account A and then sleep,giving
Thread 2 to acquire a lack on account B.
👉Now,Thread-1 waits for Account A & Thread-2 waits for Account B.
👉Since neither thread releases the lock, both keep waiting & thus creating a Deadlock❌
ℹ️Deadlock occurs when each thread is holding a resources waiting for other to release it.
